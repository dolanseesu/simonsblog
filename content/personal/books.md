This article contains some books I read and loved and I really recommend to anyone who is interested.

I will update this article from time to time, so make sure to check in every now and then!

## 1984

```
Big Brother is watching you.
```

George Orwell paints a dark and grim future in the year 1984. The plot plays in the city Airstrip One (which used to be London). It is the captital of Oceania, one of three superpowers.

Whole Oceania gets rules by "the party", lead by Big Brother. The party is divided into four ministries: the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Love, the Ministry of Peace and the Ministry of Plenty. Ironnically, each one serves the qute opposite of their names: They spread lies and indoctrinate the citizens (even with a new language, called Newspeak), forbid love and close relationships in any way, wage war and let the population of Airstrip One starve.

The Thoughtpolice monitors their citizens with telescreens, which will listen to with any held conversation, are powered on 24/7 and can't be turned off. The only place that can't be controlled is the mind. But people even get arrested and "vaporized" if they start talking in their sleep.

What makes this book so relevant today, are the countless parallels between the book and todays (dystopian) world. Mass surveillance organized by governments in public spaces through security cameras (always under the cloak of "safety"), monitoring of every Internet connection or Chinas Social Credit system. Nearly everyone carries a surveillance device in form of their smartphone with then nowadays. For instance, Google was found to still track your location even with [Airplane mode turned on](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/7811918/google-is-tracking-you-even-with-airplane-mode-turned-on/).

Newspeak slowly becomes the norm with more and more "offensive" words getiing banned (anyone who has used Twitter lately will know what I mean).

## The Magic Mountain

```
Tolerance becomes a crime when applied to evil.
```

A novel by german author Thomas Mann. If you are able to, read it in german, his usage of the language is outstanding and nearly unmatched.

The main character, Hans Castorp visits his cousin in a swiss sanatory and results in a seven year long stay. While the story itself is rather linear and unexciting, the interactions between the characters reflect the athmosphere of the european society before World War I and many things held true in the behaviour of people today.

Mann touches many topics, like love, illnes and death and time. He also reflects on many social concepts like Humanism, Radicalism, and Duty.

The nearly one thousand pages can be a bit long and tedious at times but it is defenitly worth the read. Mann himself suggests, that you have to read it twice to fully understand it.

## Animal Farm

```
All Animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.
```

Another classic by George Orwell, this short story provides a satirical view on many revolutions which happend in past history. The Animals living on Manor Farm decide to free themselves from human reign and esablish a society on their own. But as time progresses, the idealistic ideas of the revolution get more and more currupted and the animals become more and more like humans, what they swore never to become.

## Meditations

```
When you arise in the morning, think of what a privilege it is to be alive -
to think, to enjoy, to love.
```

A book by roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, who ruled from 161 to 180. The end of his reign also ended a long period of peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He was known to be a Stoic philosopher and hat many different views on live, which he expressed in this book. He touches on many topics, like human interaction, being a part of society, duty, death, love and many more.

The book is meant to inspire you to reflect on your life and to rethink your behaviour. The most atonishing thing, however is, that people haven't changed a slight bit and still behave like they did nearly 2000 years ago. And you will find many things in your own life that you should address and change for the better.
