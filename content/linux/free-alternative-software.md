This Article shows you some great free and open source software you can use to replace many proprietary (and often very expensive) programs. So if cost is a factor, this is one for you! As all of these programs are free, you can just try them and, if you don't like the experiece, just go back to what you have used before. But maybe you get the hang of free software and will consider switching to more FOSS in the future!

## [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

Probably the most-known alternative to Microsoft Office. LibreOffice is a completely free and open-source full featured office suite with a text processor, presentation program, spreadsheet program and much more. It has all the features you know from MS Office and transitioning really isn't a problem. You will get used to the interface no time.

___Note:__ If you have to work with MS Office files (`.docx` or `.pptx` for example), stick to MS Office. Opening these files in LibreOffice can (or rather will) mess up the layout and if you have to use templates, then you will have a bad time._

## [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)

If you are using Chrome or Edge, you really should consider switching. These browsers are made to generate as much data about their users as possible. And given the fact that there are many privacy-oriented browsers out there, you really don't have any reason to use Chrome.

The Brave browser gets developed by a team around Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and one of the founders of the Mozilla Foundation. Brave is based on the Chromium browser, so you will get the security and stability from Chrome with the known look and feel. Brave has a built-in Ad-Blocker (a feature every browser should have in my opinion), blocks trackers and automatically upgrades your connection to https, if possible.

Brave has a new approach of handling ads. The ads on a page get removed and instead Brave places its own ads on the page (if you volontarily consent to it). As a "reward" for lokking at these ads, Brave gives you a small amount of BAT, their own cryptocurrency.

There was a bit of a controversy around BAT in the past, as you have to use your real name and bank account to sign up for it and it had some privacy concerns as it was leaking the users IP adresses.

My recommendation is to use Brave without BAT, just ignore the whole reward system and you have a really good, fast and secure browser for day-to-day use. There is also a mobile version, which also blocks ads and trackers by default.

___Note:__ I know there are many more privacy-focused browsers with different pros and cons. I discussed these [here](/privacy/browsers)._

## [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)

A well known and free music and video player. Everyone has seen the orange traffic cone at one point and there is a reason it is so popular: It's a lightweight program with many features (including streaming). supports every video and audio format known to man and runs on every plattform. Also you can change the interface with many different themes if you don't like the default one.

## [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)

A great alternative mail client which can replace the default Windows mail program. Thunderbird is developed by the Mozilla Foundation and the interface is similar to Mozilla Firefox. It handels and IMAP, POP and SMTP server and is a great tool if you have to manage many different e-mail accounts. It's available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

## [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

Looking for a free alternative to Photoshop? Look no further! GIMP has all the features you are used to using in Photoshop for exactly zero bucks. Also it respects your privacy and you dont need an account to use it. The interface differs from Photoshop, as it has its own design idas, but you will get used to it in no time. Many content creators on youtube use GIMP as a free alternative and there are tons of tutorials available.

## [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/)

If you are more the movie-kinda-guy and are in the market for a video editing program, have a look at Kdenlive. It may not have all the features that Premiere or Davinci Resolve offer, but depending on your use cast it might just be enough. Also considering the fact that you don't have to pay a single dime for it. Other great free alternatives are [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) and [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/).

## [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

A great cross-platform audio software which enables you to edit multiple tracks and record your own audio. It is even used by many professionals (I work at a radio station and everyone is using Audacity to edit and record stuff). Getting to know the program and its many features is really easy and intuitive, so you can create your own projects really fast.

## [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

If live streaming is your thing, then lokk no further! OBS is a fantastic, free and open source program to manage all your resources while streaming. It allows many different scenes, has nearly endless settings and is really easy to get into. It is widly used by many streamers on platforms like Twitch or Youtube.

## Windows and MacOS

Linux. There you have it. It's your free and open-source operating system at no cost and without all the privacy concerns that surround Windows or OS/X. If you have never used Linux before, the are two distros you can try (distro is short for distribution and essentially means a sort of "flavor" of the Linux system).

[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) if you are coming from Windows.

It has a similar look and feel to Windows with its Cinnamon Desktop and provides an easy entry into the Linux world. The setup is simple and you can use it without ever touching the terminal or being an otherwise technically inclined person.

[Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) if you are coming from Mac.

What I said about Linux Mint, also applies here. The look and feel of Elementary OS tries to replicate the one of OS/X, so Mac users should feel at home in no time.

_Note: Altough these operating systems feel similar to Windows or Mac and also have a similar workflow, don't expect them be exact clones. Linux has its own identity and design language and these are probably the ones that come closest._
