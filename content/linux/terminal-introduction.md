This article gives a short introduction to the Linux terminal, aimed at new users.

## Header

If you are relatively new to Linux, chances are, that you had to use the Terminal at some point. Compared to Windows or OS/X, the whole process of managing your system or navigating between folders can all be done in the terminal. In fact, many applications are just a graphical front end for some terminal command.

## Opening the Terminal

If you are on Ubuntu (or any of its derivatives, like Linux Mint), the default keyboard shortcut to open the terminal is `Ctrl + Alt + T` or `Super + T` (Super is in most cases the key with the windows symbol.)
