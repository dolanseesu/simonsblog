Welcome to my organized chaos.

I'm Simon Hensel, business informatics student living in Germany. Interested in computers (especially Linux), coding and cyber security.

Like all german, I like to drink beer, wear Lederhosen and eat Bratwurst. At least thats what everyone else seems to think of us. Though I have to admit, I quite like beer.

Jokes aside, when I'm not writing papers or studying for exams I like to travel and meet new people, cook delicious food or grab a book and forget about the world for a while.

I startet this blog out of pure fun and curiosity. All opinions are my own and this site is in no way sponsored by anyone. I created the pages with [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io) and all what you see right now is hosted for free on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The whole repository is posted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dolanseesu/simonsblog).
