These are the files for my static website, created with Hugo. I use the Mainroad theme with custom css.

## Original Hugo file structure

Since git doens't include empty folders, here is the orinigal file structure in case it is needed.

- archetypes/
- content/
  - about/
  - linux/
  - personal/
  - privacy/
  - projects/
- data/
- layouts/
- resources/\_gen/images/
- themes/
